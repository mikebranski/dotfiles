# Quick shortcut to an editor.
#
# This means that as I travel back and forth between editors, hey, I don't have
# to re-learn any arcane commands. Neat.
#
# When $EDITOR is set to one with a GUI, it's not uncommon to pass a wait flag
# to the command, which instructs the shell to wait for the passed files to
# close before returning. This allows us to use e.g. Sublime Text for our Git
# commit messages. However, to avoid having to hit Ctrl + Z every time we invoke
# this editor shortcut, we simply background the task which will end when the
# original file or directory is closed.
#
# USAGE:
#
#   $ e
#   # => opens the current directory in your editor
#
#   $ e .
#   $ e /usr/local
#   # => opens the specified directory in your editor
